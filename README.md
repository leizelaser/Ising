# Ising Models and its derivatives

Ising model is a basic model in phyiscs, probability theories and statisics, and widely used as a fundamental example in programming teaching and illustrating.
This repository is built on the purpose of including different alogrithms, based on different programming languages.

We have:
* Local Monte Carlo, Metropolis and heat-bath, in Julia
* Swendsen-Wang's Cluster Monte Carlo, in Julia
* Wolff's Cluster Monte Carlo, in Julia

To be implemented:
* Wang-Landau DOS sampling, in Julia
* Parallel tempering, in MPI-C++
* Checkerboard parallelization, in OpenMP, Cuda

------
In the future plan, continuous model such as XY model, and more algorithms such as event-chains, Microcanonical sampling will be added in.
